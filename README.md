# AQT

This is a tool to make things easier and faster than going into the ACAS and VSphere web interfaces when dealing with vulnerabilities. Ultimately combining ACAS to VM data and export spreadsheets with custom columns and data for all assets that is easy to reference - Providing custom and personable context to the environment.

Current Functionality:

1. Connects to ACAS and VSphere API's
2. Lists Vulns, lists VM's
3. Functionality to add comments per vuln, and per VM or bulk change. Mark VM's importance. Mark whether vuln is exempt including reason.
4. Export to CSV, combined or individually - With custom notes and columns
5. Parser tool to quickly search and filter vulns in your environment, as well as VM's
6. Backend stuff that connects the vulns to the VM's for easy association and visualization
7. Graphing
8. A solutionizer, which lets you categorize vulnerabilities by your own environments difficulty to patch - Then recommends from easy to difficult to get the most done quickly
9. ACAS scanner - Kick off scans in an instant
10. Wordcloud to quickly visualize the most prevalent vulns with custom word list options
11. Email and built in changeable themes
